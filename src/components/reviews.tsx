I‚Äôve been skimming for the past few months, but this deep dive really brought to mind some of the deep systemic framings that we need to have to adjust our direction.

I live in Chico, CA near where the Camp Fire and Park Fire happened, and I have family both down south in LA and north in Redding where the Carr fire was. As you can imagine I have been sufficiently fatigued on fires, but this was a great and refreshing article to reframe your mind and the problems at hand, so thank you again!',

I was happy to find your email in my inbox as your takes on the world always interest me. Tonight, I find that you have quieted my mind in some way (not for the first time), enough to reach out for an expression of gratitude. Your style of discussion and communication, of balancing the good and the bad with reality and hope, is what is missing from public discussion. As a young woman struggling to look her personal and planet-wide future in the face, I appreciate you.',
